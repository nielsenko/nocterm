/// A widget that describes this app to the terminal emulator and provides navigation.
///
/// [NoctermApp] provides:
/// - Declarative terminal window title and icon name setting (via OSC escape sequences)
/// - Built-in navigation support via [Navigator]
/// - Routing configuration similar to Flutter's [MaterialApp]
///
/// Similar to Flutter's [MaterialApp] and [WidgetsApp], this widget should
/// typically be the root of your TUI application.
///
/// ## Simple Usage (No Navigation):
/// ```dart
/// void main() async {
///   await runApp(
///     NoctermApp(
///       title: 'My TUI App',
///       iconName: 'MyApp',
///       child: MyHomeScreen(),
///     ),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## With Navigation:
/// ```dart
/// void main() async {
///   await runApp(
///     NoctermApp(
///       title: 'My TUI App',
///       home: HomeScreen(),
///       routes: {
///         '/settings': (context) => SettingsScreen(),
///         '/about': (context) => AboutScreen(),
///       },
///     ),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The [title] parameter sets the terminal window title (OSC 2), and [iconName]
/// sets the terminal icon name (OSC 1). If only [title] is provided, both the
/// window title and icon name will be set to the same value (OSC 0).
///
/// These escape sequences are supported by most modern terminal emulators
/// including xterm, iTerm2, GNOME Terminal, Windows Terminal, and others.
class NoctermApp extends StatefulComponent {

  /// provided, the title will also be used as the icon name.
