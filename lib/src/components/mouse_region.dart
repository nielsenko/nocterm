/// ```dart
/// MouseRegion(
///   onEnter: (event) => print('Mouse entered at ${event.x}, ${event.y}'),
///   onExit: (event) => print('Mouse left'),
///   onHover: (event) => print('Mouse moved to ${event.x}, ${event.y}'),
///   child: Container(
///     width: 20,
///     height: 5,
///     child: Text('Hover over me'),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
