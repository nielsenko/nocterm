# Unreleased

## New Features
- **RepaintBoundary**: Add widget that caches a subtree into a sub-buffer; wrap animation hotspots to skip full-tree paint walks

## Performance
- **Paint Dispatch**: Route parent->child paints through paintWithContext so RepaintBoundary caching engages and error boxes render consistently

## Bug Fixes
- **Paint Pipeline**: Stop flushPaint from clearing _needsPaint before the root paint walk

---

# 0.9.0

## Features
- **Box-line blending**: Dividers and borders now merge with box-drawing characters they overlap, forming junctions (`├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼`) instead of leaving gaps. Every line character is modeled as four arms (up/right/down/left) with light/heavy/double weights; drawing one on another combines the arms and emits the matching glyph. New `mergeBoxCharacters`/`mergeArmsIntoCharacter` utilities, `TerminalCanvas.drawText(blendBoxLines:)`, and `TerminalCanvas.drawJunction`
- **Divider**: A negative `indent`/`endIndent` reaches the divider outside its own bounds; those cells contribute only the arm pointing back into the rule, so an end landing on a border forms a tee (`├`), not a cross. An end with nothing to join paints nothing
- **BoxBorder**: An overlaid panel's border corners merge with box characters beneath them, so a docked panel tees into the border it lands on
- **BoxBorderStyle.bold**: New heavy border style (`┏ ━ ┓`)
- Demo: `example/box_line_blending_demo.dart` shows dividers, crossings, all weights, and an overlaid panel

## Behavior Changes
- **Blending is always on** for `Divider`, `VerticalDivider`, and border corners (the `ascii` divider style never merges). When both characters carry an arm in the same direction, the newly drawn character wins (z-order), so drawing `╭` over `┌` rounds the corner and vice versa
- **Dotted borders**: Edges now use light triple-dash (`┄ ┆`) instead of heavy (`┅ ┇`) to match their light corners

## Bug Fixes
- **Divider**: No longer throws (discarding the whole frame) when laid out under unbounded constraints
- **Divider**: A cell the merge leaves unchanged keeps its original style instead of being recolored
- **BoxBorder**: Vertical sides run the full height of the box when no top/bottom border paints the end cells, so backgrounds no longer show holes
- **BorderTitle**: A styled title keeps the panel background instead of showing what was underneath
- **LogServer**: Each server can publish its port to its own file (`portFilePath`), so multiple servers in one process no longer race on the pid-keyed global file
- **getProjectDirectory**: Accepts an explicit starting directory to avoid racing on process-wide `Directory.current`

---

# 0.8.0

## Bug Fixes
- **IME composition (Windows/CJK)**: Emit each rendered frame in a single pipe write so the terminal never anchors the IME composition window to a transient streaming cell — fixes IME window flickering across the screen during chat/log streaming
- **IME cursor**: Stabilize IME cursor position to prevent Chinese input flickering
- **TextField cursor**: Correct cursor position with multiple consecutive newlines
- **Windows input**: Restore `ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT` so Ctrl+C generates SIGINT
- **Windows input**: Cap the input loop wait so timers and signals fire reliably
- **Win32 input**: Encode `KEY_EVENT_RECORD.uChar` as UTF-8 for correct IME input
- **Win32 mouse**: Forward bare mouse motion as SGR button 35 so hover works
- **Character width**: Keep East Asian Ambiguous punctuation single-width
- **Selection**: Edge auto-scroll during selection drag in scroll views
- **Terminal shutdown**: Stop sending DECRDA query on TUI shutdown
- **Project paths**: Terminate `getProjectDirectory` walk at Windows drive roots
- **TextField**: Use `InputDecoration` instead of `BoxDecoration`

## Refactoring
- **Character width**: Delegate CJK classification to the xterm wcwidth table

## Chores
- **CI**: Bump GitHub Actions to node24-compatible majors
- Strengthen the test suite with additional matchers, audit fixes, and gap coverage

# 0.7.0

## Layout pipeline

The layout-skip check now uses value equality on constraints instead of
`identical()`, and every core mutation path marks layout explicitly. Apps
get strictly fewer redundant relayouts than 0.6.0 (which effectively
re-laid out the full tree every frame), while content updates render
reliably.

## Bug Fixes
- **Overlay/Stack positioning**: Mark parent dirty when applying Positioned parent data, including the copy-in-place path used inside Overlay/Navigator (fixes overlay children frozen at stale positions)
- **Padding/Align**: Convert RenderPadding and RenderPositionedBox to compare-and-mark setters so padding/alignment changes re-layout (fixes stale layout when constraints are unchanged)
- **Child reorder**: Mark layout when moving render children, so reordering const/keyed children in Row/Column/Stack takes effect
- **ListView/LayoutBuilder**: Always mark layout in update() — a stable (hoisted) builder reading mutated state now re-renders instead of pinning stale content
- **ListView**: Evict stale separator cache entries when itemCount shrinks
- **Element slots**: Propagate slot changes for identity-equal components, so reordering const children updates paint order
- **Ticker**: Skip tail reschedule when onTick stops and restarts the ticker (fixes orphaned frame callbacks with AnimationController status listeners)
- **Selection**: Notify listeners on selection drag state mutations so list viewports repaint selection bands

## New APIs
- **EdgeInsets**: Value equality (`==`/`hashCode`), matching Flutter semantics

## Performance
- **Render pipeline**: markNeedsLayout/markNeedsPaint are idempotent — already-dirty nodes short-circuit instead of re-walking to the root

## Example
- Interactive `relayout_fixes_demo.dart` exercising the layout-mark paths, with an e2e smoke test

---

# 0.1.0

## Breaking Changes

### ListView
- **BREAKING**: Removed automatic keyboard navigation from ListView. Applications must now manually wrap ListView in Focusable for keyboard support:
  ```dart
  // Before (0.0.1)
  ListView(children: [...])

  // After (0.1.0)
  Focusable(
    onKeyEvent: (event) { /* handle navigation */ },
    child: ListView(children: [...]),
  )
  ```
