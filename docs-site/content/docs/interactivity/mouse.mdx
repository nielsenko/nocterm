Mouse support in TUIs is optional but enhances usability. This guide covers mouse event handling.

## Mouse events

Not all terminals support mouse events. When available, Nocterm handles mouse clicks, scrolling, and movement.

### Automatic mouse support

Some components handle mouse automatically:
- `ListView`: Mouse wheel scrolling
- `TextField`: Click to position cursor
- Buttons and interactive components

### Terminal compatibility

Mouse support varies:
- **Works**: iTerm2, Windows Terminal, modern terminals
- **Limited**: macOS Terminal (basic support)
- **None**: Some older or minimal terminals

Always provide keyboard alternatives for accessibility.

## Best practices

### Always provide keyboard alternatives

Every mouse action needs a keyboard shortcut:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    // Works with both mouse and keyboard
    Button(
      onPressed: () => save(),
      child: Text('Save (Ctrl+S)'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

### Test without mouse

Ensure your app works without a mouse:
1. Disable mouse in your terminal settings
2. Navigate your entire app using only keyboard
3. Check that all features remain accessible

### Use mouse for convenience

Mouse is a convenience feature, not a requirement:
- Quick selection in lists
- Faster scrolling
- Point-and-click for discovery

But keyboard should always be sufficient.

### Document mouse features

Tell users about mouse support:

```dart
Text('Use arrow keys or mouse wheel to scroll')
```

## When to use mouse

Mouse works well for:
- Scrolling long lists
- Clicking buttons
- Selecting items from menus
- Positioning cursor in text

Mouse is less useful for:
- Complex navigation
- Rapid input
- Automation
- Accessibility

## Terminal-specific behavior

Different terminals handle mouse differently:

**iTerm2 (macOS)**:
- Full mouse support
- Clicks, scrolling, hover
- Best mouse experience

**Windows Terminal**:
- Good mouse support
- Clicks and scrolling work well

**macOS Terminal**:
- Basic mouse support
- Some features may not work

**tmux/screen**:
- Mouse pass-through may need configuration
- Test in your target environment
