ANSI escape codes are special character sequences that control how terminals display text. This guide explains what they are and how Nocterm uses them behind the scenes.

## What are ANSI codes?

ANSI codes are sequences that start with the escape character (`\x1b` or `ESC`) followed by commands in brackets.

For example:
- `\x1b[31m` makes text red
- `\x1b[1m` makes text bold
- `\x1b[2J` clears the screen
- `\x1b[10;5H` moves the cursor to row 10, column 5

When you write `print('\x1b[31mHello\x1b[0m')`, the terminal sees the code, changes the text color to red, prints "Hello", then resets the color.

Most terminals support ANSI codes, making them the standard way to add colors and formatting to terminal output.

## Colors

Terminals support different levels of color:

### 16 basic colors

The original ANSI standard defines 16 colors:
- 8 normal colors: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white
- 8 bright variants of those colors

These work on almost every terminal.

### 256-color mode

Extended color palettes with 256 colors. This includes:
- The 16 basic colors
- A 216-color RGB cube
- 24 grayscale shades

Most modern terminals support this.

### True color (24-bit RGB)

Full RGB color with 16 million colors. You can specify any RGB value like `rgb(123, 45, 67)`.

Many modern terminals support this, but not all.

### What Nocterm does

Nocterm provides color constants like `Colors.red`, `Colors.blue`, etc. You use them like this:

```dart
Text('Hello', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red))
```

Nocterm handles the ANSI codes for you. You never write `\x1b[31m` directly.

## Text styling

ANSI codes support various text styles:
- **Bold**: Makes text stand out
- **Italic**: Slanted text (not all terminals support this)
- **Underline**: Underlined text
- **Dim**: Faded text
- **Strikethrough**: Text with a line through it

Support varies by terminal. Bold and underline work almost everywhere. Italic is less common.

In Nocterm, you apply styles through `TextStyle`:

```dart
TextStyle(
  color: Colors.green,
  bold: true,
  underline: true,
)
```

## Cursor control

TUIs need to position the cursor precisely to draw UI elements. ANSI codes control cursor movement:
- Move to a specific position
- Move up, down, left, right
- Hide or show the cursor

For example, to draw a box, you move the cursor to each corner and print the border characters.

Nocterm handles all cursor positioning. When you use `Column`, `Row`, or other layouts, Nocterm calculates where each component goes and moves the cursor automatically.

## Screen manipulation

ANSI codes can also:
- Clear the screen or parts of it
- Scroll regions up or down
- Save and restore cursor position

Nocterm uses these to optimize rendering. When your UI changes, Nocterm updates only the parts that changed instead of redrawing everything.

## Why you don't write ANSI codes

Without a framework, building a TUI means writing lots of ANSI codes:

```dart
// Without Nocterm
print('\x1b[2J'); // Clear screen
print('\x1b[1;1H'); // Move to top-left
print('\x1b[31;1m'); // Red, bold
print('Hello');
print('\x1b[0m'); // Reset
```

With Nocterm, you write declarative UI code:

```dart
// With Nocterm
Text('Hello', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, bold: true))
```

Nocterm generates the correct ANSI codes and handles terminal differences for you.
