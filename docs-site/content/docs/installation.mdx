## Prerequisites

You need:

- Dart SDK 3.0.0 or later
- A terminal emulator (any modern terminal works)

## Add Nocterm to your project

Add `nocterm` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  nocterm: ^0.1.0
```

Then install the package:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Verify the installation

Create a file called `hello.dart` and add this code:

```dart
import 'package:nocterm/nocterm.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    Center(
      child: Text('Hello, Nocterm!'),
    ),
  );
}
```

Run the app:

```bash
dart run hello.dart
```

You should see "Hello, Nocterm!" displayed in the center of your terminal.

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.
