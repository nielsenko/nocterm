Hot reload works just like in Flutter. When you save a file, your app updates instantly while preserving state.

## Enabling hot reload

Run your app with the `--enable-vm-service` flag:

```bash
dart --enable-vm-service your_app.dart
```

When your app starts, you'll see:

```
The Dart VM service is listening on http://127.0.0.1:8181/...
```

Now just save your files. Nocterm watches for changes and reloads automatically.

## What gets preserved

- **State**: Values in `State` objects stay the same
- **Position**: Your place in the UI (selected tab, scroll position, etc.)

## What needs a restart

Some changes require stopping and restarting your app:

- Modifying `main()`
- Changing global variables
- Modifying `initState()` (existing state won't re-initialize)

## Next steps

- [Layout](/components/layout) - Build UIs with layout components
- [Text & Styling](/components/text) - Style your text
- [Input](/components/input) - Add user input
