title: What is Nocterm?
description: A Flutter-like framework for building beautiful Terminal UIs in Dart
---

Nocterm is a framework for building Terminal User Interfaces (TUIs) in Dart. If you know Flutter, you already know how to use Nocterm—it uses the same patterns, components, and APIs you're familiar with.

In this guide, you'll learn what Nocterm is, when to use it, and what makes it different from other terminal frameworks.

## Why use Nocterm?

Building terminal apps usually means dealing with low-level terminal codes, managing cursor positions, and handling complex state. Nocterm removes that complexity by giving you Flutter's declarative UI model in the terminal.

You get:
- **Familiar API**: Use `StatefulComponent`, `setState()`, `Column`, `Row`, and other Flutter concepts
- **Hot reload**: See changes instantly during development
- **Rich components**: Text styling, layouts, scrolling, input fields, and markdown rendering
- **Testing**: Write tests for your TUI just like you test Flutter apps
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## A simple example

Here's a complete counter app:

```dart
import 'package:nocterm/nocterm.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const Counter());
}

class Counter extends StatefulComponent {
  const Counter({super.key});

  @override
  State<Counter> createState() => _CounterState();
}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  int _count = 0;

  @override
  Component build(BuildContext context) {
    return Focusable(
      focused: true,
      onKeyEvent: (event) {
        if (event.logicalKey == LogicalKey.space) {
          setState(() => _count++);
          return true;
        }
        return false;
      },
      child: Container(
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          border: BoxBorder.all(color: Colors.gray),
        ),
        margin: EdgeInsets.all(8),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            Text('Counter: $_count'),
            SizedBox(height: 1),
            Text('Press SPACE to increment', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.gray)),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

If you've used Flutter, this code should look familiar. You create components, manage state with `setState()`, and compose UIs using layout widgets.

## When to use Nocterm

Nocterm is a good choice when you need:
- **Developer tools**: Build CLIs with rich interactive interfaces (log viewers, build tools, debuggers)
- **System administration**: Create monitoring dashboards or configuration tools
- **Data exploration**: Display tables, logs, or real-time data in the terminal
- **Prototypes**: Quickly build interactive terminal apps without learning terminal APIs

Nocterm is **not** designed for simple command-line tools that just print text and exit. For those, use standard Dart I/O.

## What you'll find in Nocterm

Nocterm includes:
- Layout components: `Column`, `Row`, `Stack`, `Container`, `Expanded`
- Text components: `Text`, `RichText`, markdown rendering
- Input components: `TextField`, `Focusable` for keyboard handling
- Scrolling: `ListView`, `ScrollView` with mouse wheel support
- State management: Built-in `StatefulComponent` and Riverpod integration
- Navigation: Overlay system for dialogs and modals
- Testing: `testNocterm()` function and test matchers

## Project status

> **Note**: Nocterm is in early development (version 0.1.0). APIs may change in future releases. Use it for projects where you can tolerate breaking changes.
